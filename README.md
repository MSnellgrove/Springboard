# Springboard Data Science Projects

This repository holds most of my notebooks from my Data Science Certification. 

## Projects of note:

- My Capstone Two: Building a Model to Predict Airline Ticket Prices

  [https://github.com/MSnellgrove/Springboard/tree/main/Projects/Capstone]
  In this project, I build a Random Forest model.

- My Capstone Three: Classifying Fetal Health from CTG Data
  
  [https://github.com/MSnellgrove/Springboard/tree/main/Projects/Capstone%20Three]
  In this project, I use a Gradient Boosting model.

Both of the above projects are 100% my own creation. 

## Favorite Case Studies from Course:

- Examples of my SQL work including joins and nested queries
  
  [https://github.com/MSnellgrove/Springboard/blob/main/Projects/SQL%20Mini%20Project/SQLTasks%20Tier%201%20Complete.sql]

- Connecting to a Database and running SQL in Python

These notebooks are provided by my course and I fill in code. I build upon these to help me build new projects!
